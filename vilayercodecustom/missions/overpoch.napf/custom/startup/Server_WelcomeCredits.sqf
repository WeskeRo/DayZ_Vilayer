/* SCRIPT NAME: Server Intro Credits Script by IT07
/* SCRIPT VERSION: v1.3.5 BETA
/* Credits for original script: Bohemia Interactive http://bistudio.com
/* =======================================================================
 
/* *********************************************************************** */
 
// ========== SCRIPT CONFIG ============
_onScreenTime = 6; //how long one role should stay on screen. Use value from 0 to 10 where 0 is almost instant transition to next role
//NOTE: Above value is not in seconds!
 
// ==== HOW TO CUSTOMIZE THE CREDITS ===
// If you want more or less credits on the screen, you have to add/remove roles.
// Watch out though, you need to make sure BOTH role lists match eachother in terms of amount.
// Just take a good look at the _role1 and the rest and you will see what I mean.
 
// For further explanation of it all, I included some info in the code.
 
// == HOW TO CUSTOMIZE THE COLOR OF CREDITS ==
// Find line **** and look for: color='#f2cb0b'
// The numbers and letters between the 2 '' is the HTML color code for a certain yellow.
// If you want to change the color of the text, search on google for HTML color codes and pick the one your like.
// Then, replace the existing color code for the code you would like to use instead. Don't forget the # in front of it.
// HTML Color Codes Examples:
// #FFFFFF (white)
// #000000 (black) No idea why you would want black, but whatever
// #C80000 (red)
// #009FCF (light-blue)
// #31C300 (Razer Green)
// #FF8501 (orange)
